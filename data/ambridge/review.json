They will ask what toppings when they need to know.\n\nThe guys always remember who ordered what and how many.

We had read about Nelias on Yelp and had been looking forward to trying it.  Whenever we pulled up to the restaurant I have to admit that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  It was fairly small with a picnic table and large smoker in front.  The doors to head into the restaurant were made of streamer-like plastic.  Once inside we were facing the kitchen, a cash register and a soda cooler.  There was also a dining room next to this which I never did see since we ended up sitting outside at the picnic table.\n\nSince my wife and I were both interested in trying both the BBQ and Filipino food here, we decided to split a number of things.  We ended up ordering a half a rack of ribs with sides of fries and linguine pasta salad as well as a chicken on a stick with white rice and then pork adobo.  This was after we tried ordering fried rice instead of white rice and also chicken adobo instead of pork adobo, both of which they were out of.  After ordering we went outside and took a seat to wait for our food.  The first items out to us were the fries and pasta salad.  The fries looked like they were freshly cut, had a nice seasoning on them and tasted great when hot.  Meanwhile I wasn't expecting much out of the pasta salad.  It ended up exceeding my expectations though and was much better than expected.  As we were eating those two items our ribs came out next.  The ribs ended up being pretty good with the ones near the end of the rack being a bit tougher than I would have liked while the ones in the middle were falling off the bone.  Last but not least our pork adobo and chicken on a stick came out.  It looked like they had the exact same sauce on them so I was surprised by the very different flavors between the two.  Both of them ended up tasting really good and having tender and moist meat.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would head back to Nelias again in the future.  I don't know that I would make it the only reason to head out to Ambridge but would definitely give it a shot if you are going to be in the area.", "date": "2015-09-26 11:57:08"}

After a longer-than-expected hike at Raccoon Creek State Park, we were both quite hungry.  Rather than heading back the way we came and paying homage to the mecca of chain casual dining that is Robinson, I suggested that we venture a bit out of our way to check out what is, to my knowledge, the only restaurant in the greater PGH area that serves Filipino food.  Given that CM is of Filipino heritage, he was eager to try it, as well, so we headed over to Ambridge.\n\nUpon seeing that Nelia's serves lumpia and chicken/pork adobo, CM became very excited, since he rarely sees these dishes offered at restaurants.  Because their standard lumpia contain ground beef, which I don't eat, we split the order and got 6 beef and 6 fish (salmon) lumpia.  For entrees, we ordered the chicken adobo and chicken on a stick.  They also offered kaldereta, a pork-based stew, but CM nixed it, since he's not a big fan of Filipino stews.  Finally, I ordered a glass of the fresh squeezed lemonade ($2.50).  I don't remember the exact prices of everything, and I forgot to take a picture of the menu, but our total check came to $22.50, which I felt was quite reasonable for the amount of food that we received.\n\nUnfortunately, despite his enthusiasm, CM wasn't able to try the food on the spot, since he is very susceptible to motion sickness, which hit him from the hilly drive over about 10 min. after being seated.  However, I was, and in general, I was favorably impressed.  Of the dishes I tried, my favorite, by far and away, was the chicken adobo, which was extremely flavorful and savory.  The chicken consists of all dark meat chicken, which CM informed me is quite typical of this dish.  When he tried it the next day, he said it was even better than his mom's version, which I took to be high praise.  The chicken on a stick, which consisted of a skewered and stretched chicken breast drizzled with tomato-based BBQ sauce over a bed of rice, was not bad, but nothing particularly Filipino or special (perhaps it's supposed to be a faux/Americanized Filipino dish?).  The BBQ sauce was rich and had a good flavor, though.  The fish lumpia consisted only of fish and rice, and lacked the carrots and cabbage that lumpia typically contain.  Because of this, they were rather bland, but the sweet chili dipping sauce added some welcome flavor.  According to CM, the beef lumpia were good, but not quite up to the standard of some others he's tried before.  CM said that the lumpia and chicken adobo were definitely very authentic for Filipino food, defying his expectations for ethnic food from Ambridge, PA (of all places).\n\nOverall, we were pleased with the quality of food and service that we received at Nelia's.  As others have mentioned, the ambiance is definitely no frills/hole-in-the-wall, which is my favorite type for restaurants serving ethnic food.  Re: cleanliness, the bathroom had soap in the dispenser and was acceptably clean during our visit, and I didn't notice any cross contamination (though I wasn't watching the whole time--then again, if I was going to get sick, that would have happened by now, since it's over 24 hrs. later).  The owner (Nelia) is quite personable--as we were leaving, she struck up a conversation with CM about his heritage, and upon hearing of his motion sickness ailment, advised him to drink some soda to settle his stomach.  If you happen to be in the area or are seeking a new type of food to try, I'd definitely recommend stopping by Nelia's for some Filipino specialties, and supporting this great little restaurant.", "date": "2015-04-13 17:09:05"}

I do not live in the area, but I was in town for the Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon yesterday and had to make the trip up to Ambridge to get some pizza from Pizza House, which is also informally known as \"Police Station Pizza\" since the police station used to be next door.  This pizza place has been here a very long time (since the 1950s), and they use the same recipes that they used when I was a child.  My grandparents lived in nearby Leetsdale, and we used to always get pizza from Pizza House whenever I visited them.  Everything about this place is the same as when I was a child, including the pizza itself, the order system, prices by the slice on the wall, and pizza served in white boxes. The prices have gone up with inflation, but they are still very reasonably priced.\n\nOn this visit I got some plain cheese and a pepperoni slices.  The pizza is very good, actually the best I have ever had in my life.  It is a square pizza with a very crispy bottom crust and a light and airy crust on top.  The pizza sauce is also very good, as is the cheese and pepperoni.  They put lots of cheese on it, and throw the toppings and some extra cheese on it after it comes out of the oven.  The pizza is a thick crust, kind of a cross between Sicilian style pizza served in New York City and Detroit style pizza, such as you can get at Jet's.  It is very good since they make the dough fresh daily and use high quality ingredients.  I bought a tray of the crust to take back home with me for $7.00 (of you can pay full price for the unbaked option that includes the sauce, cheese, and toppings).\n\nThe prices are very reasonable - $1.05 per cheese slice and 20 cents per topping and 25 cents for extra cheese (plus tax).  They only offer takeout pizza.  They also offer pepperoni rolls for $4.50, which they did not offer when I was a child.  They also sell bottled drinks.  The order system is very simple - you tell them how many slices you want, the toppings you want, whether you want it baked or unbaked, pay them in cash, and then wait patiently for your pizza to be ready (they have a couple of benches inside).  They are very friendly and are very efficient despite being very busy.  You can also call ahead.  I noticed that unbaked pizza orders were popular, as were full tray (24-slice) and half tray (12-slice) orders.  They are only open during the evenings, opening at 5:00 PM, and they do not take credit cards.  Note that they are closed on Sunday.\n\nIn summary, this is the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and that includes 3 trips to Italy and multiple trips to New York City and Chicago.  I highly recommend PIzza House, and if you live in PIttsburgh, it is definitely worth the trip up the Ohio River Boulevard.  I wish I could give them 10 stars, they deserve it.", "date": "2017-05-09 02:39:36"}

Our party of six all agreed that we should have stopped at McDonald's for a filet-o-fish.\n\nThe place is a dive bar- usually my favorite for fish or wings- but this place is beyond awful. \n\nFriday is the only day the place is non-smoking, so it smelled like a dirty ashtray.  Dimly lit- and thank goodness for that- it obviously was not very clean.\n\nWe arrived and were glad that the only area to seat more than 4 was available (though I honestly wish it were not, and we had been forced to go elsewhere). \n\nThey don't serve iced tea, except for cans of Lipton, and that should have tipped me off. \n\nWe ordered after only a few minutes of being seated, but then the wait began.  \n\nAfter an HOUR AND A HALF, we noticed other tables being served before us, despite arriving well after we had.  The waitress then told us that our order was next in line, but a full 20 minutes later, the same waitress told us that she had two more orders, \"and then ours would be right out.\" \n\nI am NEVER one to complain about my meal to the owners.  I figure that if I get lousy service or  bad food, I simply won't go back. \n\nFor the first time, EVER, I was forced to knock on the kitchen door to get an answer.  The manager was INCREDIBLY RUDE, and failed to even apologize.  She just said that the regulars get served first, and that I should have known that, somehow.  At the time I was invited into the kitchen, the ladies were cracking up and eating French fries from an order. Probably ours. \n\nEventually, we got our fish, which was nothing special.  Far greasier than average, fish with a bonus--  soggy black skin was visible under the breading. \n\nWe will never return to this disgusting hole-in-the-wall.  Rude management and sub-par food make this dive a no-go.", "date": "2018-03-10 04:42:41"}

Ordered a fish sandwich with fries, only available on Fridays. I've been on a fish sandwich streak lately, and I'm not even Catholic!  It was the best one I've had in quite a while - huge piece of fish, nicely crisped, with lettuce and tomato and tartar on the side. And the fries were fresh cut, hot and unsalted (or very lightly) which I love - let ME figure out how much salt they need instead of the entire lick most places put on. And a little cup of slaw that was not bathed in a creamery and had a little peppery bite. Friends had a burger and a turkey burger, and both really liked them.

We ordered the fried pickles appetizer, la flama blanca chicken sandwich with fries, and the portobello mushroom burger with a side of coleslaw.\n\nWhat's Hot\n- Quality of food.  Hubby and I liked our food.  It was delish.  His flama blanca chicken sandwich had jalape\u00f1o slices and a spicy sauce.  It had a kick and was not overwhelming.  However, be aware if you're the type that likes your food hella spicy, this won't do it.  There is malt vinegar at the table, so you can add that to your fries, tots, whatevs.  My burger patty wasn't thin and cooked to order.  \n- Non mayo coleslaw.  Dudes, it's cool to find a place where the coleslaw isn't made with mayo.  Their coleslaw is made with a vinegar sauce and there are red onion slices in the coleslaw, too.  Something different, yet delicious.  \n- Fried pickles.  They use pickles from a local Burgh pickle company, which is delish.  Their fried pickles aren't overly breaded, too, which I like.  For me, if a fried dish is thickly battered, that tells me you're trying to hide something.  These pickles are definitely sour, but have a nice flavor.  \n- Price.  For the most part, their prices are reasonable and are reflective of their portions.  For example, my burger was around $10.  The fried pickles are pricey- around $7.  Total for me and hubby was around $35, including tip.\n- Menu variety.  The menu options are decent.  It's a one page menu.  You're not overwhelmed with choices.  They have a decent bar/drinks menu, too.  It's a one small one page menu- a few wines, a handful of mixed drinks, and half the page is beer.\n- Service.  No complaints.  The waitresses were nice, helpful, and attentive.  \n\nWhat's Not\n- Layout.  To be fair, many bars/taphouses in the Burgh are small.  That brings its pros and cons.  This place is no different.  It's small and somewhat compact.  There aren't many tables.  It can get busy easy and when it does get busy, the sound will carry.  By the time we left, this place was less than half full and already it was difficult to have a conversation.  Be prepared to talk loudly and not be able to hear the conversation easily.  Additionally, none of the tables seat more than 4 people.  I don't recommend large groups.  If that's an issue, call ahead to make a reservation. \n- Dim.  The inside is very dimly lit, so it's not easy to see. \n- Parking.  It's a small town area, so there aren't many parking options around when it's busy.  Be prepared to parallel park in the neighborhood.  I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it's not the most convenient.    \n\nFinal Answer\nWilling to come back again, but not on the top of my list.", "date": "2018-06-01 23:30:11"}

Do you wait to be seated? Grab a table? If there are no tables, do you wait? Does someone make a list or do you just stand there and hope to grab a table in the dining room once someone gets up?

And of course they have the standards. The staff can help you with your selection because they know their beers. They keep a current beer menu and will get you a sample if you just can't make up your kind.  The mixed drinks are really good. They use fresh ingredients and have a good selection of top shelf options. Ok that covers the drinks. The food is really really good!  Yes it's a pub, but they do it right. Quality ingredients prepared right. You can tell they focus on the details. The burgers are great!  Thick applewood smoked bacon, quality cheeses, bakery fresh buns, red onions, fresh greens, thick tomatoes...  Again, you can tell they focus on the details to make simple foods really good. The fries are fresh cut and they keep the cooking oils fresh so they always taste great. They also have a variety of chicken sandwich. They marinaded the chicken and it always comes out tender and juicy. Their club sandwich with sundries tomato mayo is excellent. The wings are great, the scotch eggs are really good and they have good dinner and side salads.   The place is kept really clean, plenty of tv screens to keep up with the game.

Solidly one of the best Cubans I have ever had in my life.  They have this down to a science.  They use a very high quality smoked ham, sliced perfectly.   A house smoked pulled pork, just the right tang on the pickle and the exotic (not sure what kind) mustard kick was the cherry on top.   \n\nThey serve these sandwiches with either fries (very good), or tots (amazing).  Tots are an under-served side car these days, our friends at BT have found a way to make them mainstream.  If you get the tots, ask for the \"dust\" on the top.  Just like the 'spice' in Dune, this stuff is magically.  No ketchup or condiments needed if you get your tots dusted.  \n\nI have not experienced much of the draft list, just a few tastes.  I will say that it is solid and will update it as soon as I get a solid session in at the bar.  I suggest if you are near the BT, you stop in.", "date": "2017-08-27 17:49:13"}

We were on a buying trip with money to spend and a truck and trailer. Saw several pieces of mid century furniture that we were interested in buying. The first was a set of stacked cabinets that had no price. When I asked for the price I was told it wasn't for sale because he was using it for display. Okay that's not totally unreasonable except it only had two open shelves and the rest were closed cabinets so it wasn't displaying much. When I turned to the cabinet beside it that did have a price I was told that the way it works if you want to buy any of the larger pieces of furniture is that you can't take it with you on the same day you buy it but rather he will call you when he has time to move all the little things that are be displayed on it and finds somewhere else to put them. What?!?  He wasn't phased when I tried to explain to him that I was just traveling through and would be two states away by then. I did find a two piece credenza hutch that was priced and since it only had a couple of things on it I thought for sure I could talk him into selling it to me and taking it with me but he was convinced that the top hutch did not go with the bottom credenza and it did not belong to him. When I suggested that he call the seller he said he doesn't call sellers on Sunday. WTF? He said he would email the seller. Grrr. I left buying only a couple of books but could have easily dropped over a grand. I said I would be in town for an hour or two because I had an appointment to pick up some furniture so if he happened to hear back he could call me. He called me back several hours later saying that I was right, the price was for both pieces DUH. Unfortunately I was already a state away by then. I have no idea what the hell this guy is thinking. More than 90% of the storefronts on this street are closed and boarded up. Have no idea how this place is still in business when they are turning away customers. Mostly I am writing this review to inform all the poor sellers that he is renting booths to that he flat out refuses to sell your stuff.", "date": "2014-08-26 04:12:04"}

I told them I trusted them, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nFrank's does one brilliant thing I've really never seen before at any pizza restaurant: Most toppings go on fresh after baking.  Pepperonis are nice and soft, and flavorful, without being browned, curled into a little grease cup, or crisped into a blackened charcoal-tasting nastiness.

Home made mashed potatoes accompany the flavorful sandwich and we also ordered a side of fresh, homemade coleslaw that was a perfect partner to this meal. As if our stomachs could even hold another morsel--we had to try the home made chocolate pie as well. Very good, smooth and chocolatey with a layer of whipped cream on top. The chocolate syrup drizzled on top wasn't needed, as this pie was flavorful without the addition. More whipped cream would be my choice. Our waitress, Diane, was one of the nicest, friendliest and most helpful waitresses we've encountered in a long time! She gave us great recommendations for our next trip to the Maple. The original owner was there celebrating his 95th(!!!) birthday--a dear man who stopped to say hello as he passed by. God bless him--as our waitress said--\"it must be the gravy that keeps him going\"!!! We'll surely be back soon to this quaint little spot.", "date": "2016-12-28 21:33:53"}

Can you get THAT in Ambridge?\n\nYes. Yes, oh yes, oh YES you can!\n\nLittle Athen's is located on the corner of 5th St and Merchant, in a little storefront that looks like a pizza shop. But for a little shop, they boast a large menu of Greek delights (and hot dogs and french fries and the like if you've got an 'iffy about Greek food' person in your party).\n\nNo matter what else you get, snag a tub of the hummus. It is garlicky, lightly lemony, so smooth in texture, and it's wonderful with the soft, warm pita bread they serve alongside. The tabbouleh is quite good as well, and the spanikopita... DANG GIRL. It's good stuff. Cheese for days!\n\nPrices are reasonable - most menu items are between 4 and 6 dollars. And the portions are large; you can easily split a single order of the spanikopita with a friend.\n\nSo if you find yourself in Ambridge or passing through, and you're craving the best hummus of your life, stop here and pick up a to-go order.

Street parking is also available if the lot is full. \n\nMaple Restaurant celebrates its golden anniversary next year, and I certainly wish it enough longevity to earn a 10 carat diamond. \n\nWhen you first walk in, you get the impression that this diner has remained in a state of suspended animation since it opened in 1963. Aside from a few young employees, even the help was past middle-age and thus seemed to be profoundly loyal. I overheard one waitress proudly tell a customer that she had been with Maple Restaurant for 17 years. Even before we entered MR and waded through the heavy, thawing snow on quaint Maplewood Avenue (I didn't find it at all 'sketchy') early this bright afternoon, I could tell that WQED's Rick Sebak would have great fun filming a segment here.\n\nOur waitress, who served up our food in mere minutes, fussed over us as if we were her grandchildren, watching happily as we gobbled up plates of comforting chuck wagon victuals. \n\nBurgundy MR t-shirts, which are worn by the staff and can be purchased by patrons, are emblazoned on the back with \"America's #1 Hot Beef Maker.\" Roast Beef is their staple and can be had in a number of variations. \n\nKay loves hot roast beef sandwiches and ordered accordingly. She did let me try the mashed potatoes, and to me they only confirmed that the mashed potatoes  we had last night on a Dad's Pizza (of Beaver Falls)  pierogi pie were in fact instant. MR's mashed spuds were fluffy but not overly so, had just enough lumpiness, and did not have one hint of the aftertaste found with instant synthetic potato flakes; MR's are the real thing, and for that I was grateful. \n\nI almost ordered a Maple Burger, a burger that has their signature roast beef on it as well as a \"special sauce,\" but our server advised against it, telling me that she \"don't care for that one.\"\n\nMan, I love an honest server.\n\nWhen I put my finger on Big Charley, she nodded in approval.\n\n\"You're gonna like that one,\" she said with a smile as huge as the clear, blue sky above. \n\nAnd like it I did. My only real complaint with the sandwich was that the roast beef got somewhat dry towards the end, but the nicely liquefied cheese, caramelized onions, fresh, beefy tomato, snappin' BBQ sauce, and toasty bun more than made up the difference. The fries that came with it were soft, crisped, bronzed, salted excellence. \n\nI got a taste of Kay's Chocolate Cream Pie, and found that whipped cream definitely works better than meringue (I'm lookin' at you Dick's Diner of Murrysville), with this sort of dessert. \n\nI yet again went with a hot fudge brownie sundae, one that MR calls the Maple Sundae (?), and it was up to the same level I have come to expect from such an unheralded treat. The chewy, igneous brownie was buried under vanilla ice cream and a lake of equally decalescent fudge. \n\nIf you're ever hungry when traveling on Route 65, and it's not too late, give Sheetz or Eat 'N Park a pass; try Maple Restaurant instead for a home-cooked, mom/pop change of pace. Let's help keep them in the black and sustain a part of Americana along with it.", "date": "2012-01-22 22:23:24"}

The food was plentiful and hot, and the dishes were clean. The fries were hot and crisp, at least in the places that they'd not been left to soak in the gravy. The \"famous\" roast beef wasn't anything special, especially served on supermarket white bread with what tasted like very salty canned gravy. We also got a reuben (my partner and I split two sandwiches) which was ok, but nothing special--the corned beef was nothing more than deli-style corned beef; the swiss cheese was plastic-y tasting. \n\nWe passed on dessert--the meal was both filling and underwhelming enough that we were ready to move on. \n\nThe neighborhood isn't at all threatening, I don't think, but it does seem sketchy--I was panhandled in the parking lot, and that area of Ambridge has a lot of empty storefronts and boarded-up windows.

I give it four stars because it is presented well, and the staff is very good and knowledgeable.\n\nMy husband Rick and I went here last Saturday Evening (12/6/2008) for the annual Christmas At the Village.  Christmas here is wonderful!  The village is decorated in a 19th Century German style.  They have music, crafts, traditional German food (which is cooked by a local church), crafts, and family events.  They also have the \"Weihnachtsmarkt\" which sells unique handmade gifts made by local craftsmen.  I bought a few for stocking stuffers.  Another Chirstmas event (which we didn't make this year) is \"Christmas with Belsnickel\".  \"Belsnickel\" is the \"Dark Santa\" and it's his job to see if you are gonna get candy or coal in your stocking!\n\nJust a little bit of history about this place.  It was settled by the Harmony Society, a 19th-Century religious communal society.  The Harmonists were a very successful industrious people.  They created and adapted new technologies for textile manufacturing and agriculture.  They were early users of steam power in industrial uses. \n\nThe village consists of the Museum Building and Feast Hall, where communal feasts were held.  The Community Kitchen was where communal feasts were prepared.  Other buildings include the Cabinet Shop, the Blacksmith's Shop, the Grainery, the Warehouse, and the Community Store.  At the Community Store, non-Harmonists could buy Harmonist cloth.  The store also sold everyday items brought in from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.  The Visitor's Center is the main museum for the village.\n\nI should mention that the Harmonists were a sect and as a result, had some \"unusual\" beliefs.  You could even consider them early practitioners of Socialism.  And if you want to learn more, visit Old Economy Village's website www.oldeconomyvillage.org.", "date": "2008-12-11 14:20:12"}

My tour guide, Barb, was fantastic and very passionate about the history of the Harmonist Society and what they have left behind. This was my first visit to the site and I did not realize the extent of the village. My personal favorite building of the tour was the wine cellar and the sample of bread that came from the outdoor oven (the whole tour is very interactive).The Feast Hall was also impressive and the acoustics were amazing. All in all, it is hard to pick a favorite because all of the buildings on the tour were interesting in their own ways and really depict the wealth of history that is embodied by Old Economy Village. I recommend this attraction for all ages!", "date": "2017-06-07 18:30:48"}

It's as though they really care about what they are doing, while so many other local restaurants just slop things together.\n\nI recommend it highly.", "date": "2018-03-11 17:17:48"}

The Harmonists are a fascinating movement, and the Village was left pretty much intact and in 1919 became a state historic site.  \n\nYou will be fascinated by the gardens, the wine cellar, seventeen restored historic structures in all, that tell the story of this fascinating religious cult. \n\nThe guides are well trained and passionate about the subject.  There are 6 acres and lots of things to learn about, I highly recommend.", "date": "2018-06-28 17:10:21"}
